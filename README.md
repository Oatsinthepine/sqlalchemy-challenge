# sqlalchemy-challenge
This repo is for week 10 sqlalchemy challenge.

For this challenge, it contains two parts, first is using jupyter notebook to conduct climate data analysis from hawaii database. Then second is using the data to construct api route by flask to show the requested result in the web, with the sqlalchemy to connect and query from the hawaii db. 

For completing the challenge, here are the references I used.
